# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains implementations of the most important design patterns using Python, along with practical examples and comparisons between implementations with and without the pattern.

## üìã Contents

The project is organized into three main categories, following the classification from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the "Gang of Four" (GoF):

### 1. Creational Patterns
These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object

### 2. Structural Patterns
These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of maintaining many similar objects
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate to control access to another object

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
- **Iterator**: Provides sequential access to the elements of a collection
- **Mediator**: Defines how a set of objects interact
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method
- **Visitor**: Represents operations to be performed on elements of a structure

## üöÄ Project Structure

Each pattern includes:

1. Implementation without the pattern (traditional example)
2. Implementation with the pattern (improved solution)
3. Explanation of advantages and disadvantages


## üìö Application Cases

This project is especially useful for:

- Computer engineering students
- Developers interested in improving their application design
- Any project requiring maintainable and scalable code structures

## üìù Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding:

1. New practical examples
2. Alternative implementations
3. Improvements to explanations
4. Use cases in different domains
